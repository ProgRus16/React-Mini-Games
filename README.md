# A collection of mini games built with React JS

I created this collection of mini-games solely to practice using React JS (and Git). The collection currently includes 10 games: Wordle, Hangman, Tic Tac Toe, Minesweeper, Fifteen, Mad Libs (Random Story Generator), Memory Cards, Tetris, Maze, and Engineering Calculator. The controls there, like the games themselves, are very simple, and you wonâ€™t have any trouble figuring it out on your own.
