# A collection of mini games built with React JS

I created this collection of mini-games solely to practice using React JS (and Git). The collection currently includes 9 games: Wordle, Hangman, Tic Tac Toe, Minesweeper, Fifteen, Mad Libs (Random Story Generator), Memory Cards, Tetris, and Maze. The controls there, like the games themselves, are very simple, and you wonâ€™t have any trouble figuring it out on your own.
